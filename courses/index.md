### Medical & Health Physics

#### MEDP-7098 Research Technologies and Methods @ [LSU](https://lsu.edu/)

##### Course Objectives

* To teach basic research methods of relevance to thesis and dissertation research projects
conducted by graduate students.
* To teach graduate students how to prepare a written research proposal suitable for an MS or
PhD research project and general examination.

##### Taught sessions

Introduction to Linux, Introduction to Python, Introdution to C++, Introdcution to high performance computing clusters, and Introdcution to high performance programming approaches

* Materials: [Slides](https://github.com/diehlpkteaching/MEDP-7098)

### Mathematics

#### M4997 Parallel Computations Mathematics @ [LSU](https://lsu.edu/)

This course will focus on the parallel implementation of computational mathematics problemsusing modern accelerated C++. The aim of this course is to learn how to quickly write useful efficient C++ programs. The students will not learn low-level C/C++ instead they will learn howto use high-level data structures, iterators, generic strings, and streams (including interactiveand file I/O) of the C++ ISO Standard library. In addition, highly-optimized linear algebra libraries are introduced since the course teaches to solve problems, instead of explaining low-level C++ and computer science algorithms, like sorting algorithms, which are provided in the C++ standard library.

* Courses: [Fall 2019](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~pdiehl/teaching/2019/4977/), [Fall 2020](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~pdiehl/teaching/2020/4997/), and
[Fall 2021](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~pdiehl/teaching/2021/4997/).
* Materials: [Slides](https://github.com/diehlpkteaching/ParallelComputationMath), [Exercises](https://github.com/diehlpkteaching/ParallelComputationMathExercise), and [Lecture notes](https://github.com/diehlpkteaching/ParallelComputationMathScript)
