Here is a list of all the Google Summer of Code projects I mentored.

## [HPXCL](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpxcl) – Asynchronous Integration of CUDA and OpenCL to [HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx) (2017)

The project [HPXCL](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpxcl) is done by [Madhavan Seshadri](http://madhavanseshadri.com/)

### Project description

Massively parallel applications are in the dawn of our future. The scale of problems and the amount of data available have made it infeasible to solve 
a meaningful problem in a single computer. As such, in such a scale, it is imperative to combine CPUs and accelerator cards such as GPUs to achieve one 
unified computing source. HPXCL aims at unifying kernel launch and data transfer into HPX asynchronous graph through seamless integration. 
However, the current implementation of the system with CUDA fails to achieve the desired performance improvement metrics while running in a cluster 
of computers. The proposal is aimed at improving the performance of CUDA-based HPXCL applications through an ‘Event’ triggered mechanism. 
Appropriate tests are also to be written to ensure necessary functionality performs as required. 
Standard benchmarking algorithms (Floyd Warshall, FFT etc.) will also be implemented in HPXCL, OpenCL and CUDA to validate, 
measure and improve the performance of the existing system, while also keeping in mind the new functionality added.

## Implement a Map/Reduce Framework (2016)

[Map/Reduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) frameworks are getting more and more popular for big data processing (for example [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/)). By utilizing the unified and standards conforming API of the HPX run time system, we believe to be able to perfectly represent the Map/Reduce programming model. Many applications would benefit from direct support in HPX. This might include adding [Hypertable](http://hypertable.com) or similar libraries to the mix to handle the large data sets Map/Reduce is usually used with.

The project [hpxflow](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpxflow) was successfully done by [Aalekh Nigam](https://twitter.com/_aalekh).
