Sometimes, we want to obtain the floating point operations a C++ application executed to measure the performance on a single node. 

One option is the [perf](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/perf.1.html) proivied by the linux kernel tools. 

### Compile perf

If `perf` is not installed on the  Linux operating system, we need to compile `perf` as the following:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone --depth 1 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux/tools/perf
make
{% endhighlight %}
 
### Compile libpfm

To obtain the events, we want to measure using perf another tool [libpfm](https://perfmon2.sourceforge.net/) is needed. We compile
libpfm as the following

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://perfmon2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/perfmon2/libpfm4
cd libpfm4
make
{% endhighlight %}

### Obtain the event id 

To obtain all available events on the Intel CPU, we run

{% highlight bash %}
./examples/showevtinfo
{% endhighlight %}

This produces a long list of CPU information and available events, which we will have a look at. However, we are interested in floating point operations. Therefore we search in the long output for floating point operations resulting in the following events:

{% highlight bash %}
IDX      : 668991557
PMU name : skx (Intel Skylake X)
Name     : FP_ARITH
Equiv    : FP_ARITH_INST_RETIRED
Flags    : None
Desc     : Floating-point instructions retired
Code     : 0xc7
Umask-00 : 0x01 : PMU : [SCALAR_DOUBLE] : None : Number of scalar double precision floating-point arithmetic instructions (multiply by 1 to get flops)
Umask-01 : 0x02 : PMU : [SCALAR_SINGLE] : None : Number of scalar single precision floating-point arithmetic instructions (multiply by 1 to get flops)
Umask-02 : 0x04 : PMU : [128B_PACKED_DOUBLE] : None : Number of scalar 128-bit packed double precision floating-point arithmetic instructions (multiply by 2 to get flops)
Umask-03 : 0x08 : PMU : [128B_PACKED_SINGLE] : None : Number of scalar 128-bit packed single precision floating-point arithmetic instructions (multiply by 4 to get flops)
Umask-04 : 0x10 : PMU : [256B_PACKED_DOUBLE] : None : Number of scalar 256-bit packed double precision floating-point arithmetic instructions (multiply by 4 to get flops)
Umask-05 : 0x20 : PMU : [256B_PACKED_SINGLE] : None : Number of scalar 256-bit packed single precision floating-point arithmetic instructions (multiply by 8 to get flops)
Umask-06 : 0x40 : PMU : [512B_PACKED_DOUBLE] : None : Number of scalar 512-bit packed double precision floating-point arithmetic instructions (multiply by 8 to get flops)
Umask-07 : 0x80 : PMU : [512B_PACKED_SINGLE] : None : Number of scalar 512-bit packed single precision floating-point arithmetic instructions (multiply by 16 to get flops)
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we now the name `FP_ARITH` of the event and the mask `01` of the scalar double operations, we want to track using perf. To obtain the id for `perf`, we need to use the tool `check_events` provided by libpfm and execute the following command: 

{% highlight bash %}
./examples/check_events FP_ARITH:0x01
{% endhighlight %}

which will output plenty of information, however, we are only interested in the last few lines:

{% highlight bash %}
Requested Event: FP_ARITH:0x01
Actual    Event: skx::FP_ARITH_INST_RETIRED:0x1:k=1:u=1:e=0:i=0:c=0:t=0:intx=0:intxcp=0
PMU            : Intel Skylake X
IDX            : 668991558
Codes          : 0x5301c7
{% endhighlight %}

The code `5301c71` is now used within `perf` to measure the event by using `-e r5301c7`.

### Collecting performance with perf

Now, since we collected the id of the each monitored events, we can run `perf` to collect the events, which in our case are the floating point operations, as the following

{% highlight bash %}
./perf stat -e r5301c7 -e r5302c7 -e r5304c7 ./taylor 1000000000 0.5 
{% endhighlight %}

and receive the following output 

{% highlight bash %}
 Performance counter stats for './taylor 1000000000 0.5 1':

   100,000,028,581      r5301c7:u
                 0      r5302c7:u
                 0      r5304c7:u

      91.822704139 seconds time elapsed

      90.294908000 seconds user
       1.401873000 seconds sys
{% endhighlight %}

which indicates that 100,000,028,581 floating point operations using the `double` type were executed. Now we can use the obtained time and compute the FLOP/s as `100,000,028,581/91.822704139=1.09e9`.
