### Day 1

Excellent keynote "Research Software Engineers: where it started and where itâ€™s going" by Simon Hettrick [1].

I chaired the very well attened session [1B: AI, ML, and Automation](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/program/sessions/). 

Lively discussion in workshop 2: "Community discussion: teachingRSE project".

I presented the poster The Journal of Open Souce Software (JOSS) [2].

The day ended with a very nice ice cream social for the mentor programm and I had an execllent discusison with my mentee.

### Day 2

Again an excellent keynote "US-RSE: Together We Grow Strong RSE Careers and a Thriving Community" by Sandra Gesing.

Diego and I finished the USRSE24 Conference Proceedings [3] by collecting all presentations and slides.

Amazing discussion in BoFs 2: "Teaching Research Software Engineering". I was in the group math/chemistry and we discussed 
the specific competencies a research software engineering in applied mathematisc should have
* Numerical linear algebra
  * relevant libraries
  * user friendly API
* Uncertainty quantification (statistics)
* Algorithmic complexity
* Parameter tuning
* HPC + Shell
* Finite approximation
* Visualization
* File formats
* LaTex
