### Day 1

Excellent keynote "Research Software Engineers: where it started and where itâ€™s going" by Simon Hettrick.

I chaired the very well attened session [1B: AI, ML, and Automation](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/program/sessions/). 

I presented the poster The Journal of Open Souce Software ([JOSS](https://zenodo.org/records/13942443)).

The day ended with a very nice ice cream social for the mentor program and I had an execllent discusison with my mentee.
