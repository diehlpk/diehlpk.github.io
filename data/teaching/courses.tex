\subsubsection*{Parallel Computations Mathematics (M4997)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This course will focus on the parallel implementation of computational mathematics problems using modern accelerated C++. The aim of this course is to learn how to quickly write useful efficient C++ programs. The students will not learn low-level C/C++ instead they will learn howto use high-level data structures, iterators, generic strings, and streams (including interactive and file I/O) of the C++ ISO Standard library. In addition, highly-optimized linear algebra libraries are introduced since the course teaches to solve problems, instead of explaining low-level C++ and computer science algorithms, like sorting algorithms, which are provided in the C++ standard library.
