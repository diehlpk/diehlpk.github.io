  Abstract                 = {This paper shows a new approach to estimate the critical traction for Mode I crack opening before crack growth by numerical simulation. For quasi-static loading, Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts the critical traction before crack growth. To simulate the crack growth, we used bond-based peridynamics, a non-local generalization of continuum mechanics. We discretize the peridynamics equation of motion with a collocation by space approach, the so-called EMU nodal discretization. As the constitutive law, we employ the improved prototype micro brittle material model. This bond-based material model is verified by the Young's modulus from classical theory for a homogeneous deformation for different quadrature rules. For the EMU-ND we studied the behavior for different ratios of the horizon and nodal spacing to gain a robust value for a large variety of materials. To access this wide range of materials, we applied sparse grids, a technique to build high-dimensional surrogate models. Sparse grids significantly reduce the number of simulation runs compared to a full grid approach and keep up a similar approximation accuracy. For the validation of the quasi-static loading process, we show that the critical traction is independent of the material density for most material parameters. The bond-based IPMB model with EMU nodal discretization seems very robust for the ratio {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}delta {\}}/{\{}{\backslash}varDelta X{\}}=3{\$}{\$} $\delta$ / $\Delta$ X = 3 for a wide range of materials, if an error of 5 {\%} is acceptable.},

However, the technique struggles at autonomously tracking emerging and propagating cracks. We proposed a hybrid approach which utilizes image processing techniques in combination with local digital image correlation to autonomously monitor cracks in a mechanically loaded specimen. Our approach can extract and track crack surfaces and provide a volume-based visualization of the crack growth. This approach was applied to single-fiber composite experimental results with interfacial debonding from the literature. Results quantitatively show that strong interfacial fiber/matrix bonding leads to slower interfacial crack growth, delays interfacial crack growth in the matrix, requires higher loadings for crack growth and shows a specific crack path distinct from the one obtained for weak interfaces. The approach was also validated against a manual approach where a domain scientist extracts a crack using a polygon extraction tool. The method can be used on any local digital image correlation results involving damage observations."

abstract="This paper implements the virtual fields method within the ordinary state-based peridynamic framework to identify material properties. The key equations derived in this approach are based on the principle of virtual works written under the ordinary state-based peridynamic formalism for two-dimensional isotropic linear elasticity. In-house codes including a minimization process have also been developed to implement the method. A three-point bending test and two independent virtual fields arbitrarily chosen are used as a case study throughout the paper. The numerical validation of the virtual fields method has been performed on the case study by simulating the displacement field by finite element analysis. This field has been used to extract the elastic material properties and compared them with those used as input in the finite element model, showing the robustness of the approach. Noise analysis and the effect of the missing displacement fields on the specimen's edges to simulate digital image correlation limitations have also been studied in the numerical part. This work focuses on pre-damage properties to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and provides a new tool for using full-field measurements within peridynamics with a reduced calculation time as there is no need to compute the displacement field. Future works will deal with damage properties which is the main strength of peridynamics.",

abstract = "In this paper, we propose two approaches to apply boundary conditions for bond-based peridynamic models. There has been in recent years a renewed interest in the class of so-called non-local models, which include peridynamic models, for the simulation of structural mechanics problems as an alternative approach to classical local continuum models. However, a major issue, which is often disregarded when dealing with this class of models, is concerned with the manner by which boundary conditions should be prescribed. Our point of view here is that classical boundary conditions, since applied on surfaces of solid bodies, are naturally associated with local models. The paper describes two methods to incorporate classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions into bond-based peridynamics. The first method consists in artificially extending the domain with a thin boundary layer over which the displacement field is required to behave as an odd function with respect to the boundary points. The second method resorts to the idea that peridynamic models and local models should be compatible in the limit that the so-called horizon vanishes. The approach consists then in decreasing the horizon from a constant value in the interior of the domain to zero at the boundary so that one can directly apply the classical boundary conditions. We present the continuous and discrete formulations of the two methods and assess their performance on several numerical experiments dealing with the simulation of a one-dimensional bar."

abstract={On modern supercomputers, asynchronous many task systems are emerging to address the new architecture of computational nodes. Through this shift of increasing cores per node, a new programming model with focus on handling of the fine-grain parallelism with increasing amount of cores per computational node is needed. Asynchronous Many Task (AMT) run time systems represent a paradigm for addressing the fine-grain parallelism. They handle the increasing amount of threads per node and concurrency. HPX, a open source C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency, is one AMT which is conforming to the C++ standard. Motivated by the impressive performance of asynchronous task-based parallelism through HPX to N-body problem and astrophysics simulation, in this work, we consider its application to the Peridynamics theory. Peridynamics is a non-local generalization of continuum mechanics tailored to address discontinuous displacement fields arising in fracture mechanics. Peridynamics requires considerable computing resources, owing to its non-local nature of formulation, offering a scope for improved computing performance via asynchronous task-based parallelism. Our results show that HPX-based peridynamic computation is scalable, and the scalability is in agreement with the theory. In addition to the scalability, we also show the validation results and the mesh convergence results. For the validation, we consider implicit time integration and compare the result with the classical continuum mechanics (CCM) (peridynamics under small deformation should give similar results as CCM). For the mesh convergence, we consider explicit time integration and show that the results are in agreement with theoretical claims in previous works.},

    abstract = "{Octo-Tiger is an astrophysics code to simulate the evolution of self-gravitating and rotating systems of arbitrary geometry based on the fast multipole method, using adaptive mesh refinement. Octo-Tiger is currently optimised to simulate the merger of well-resolved stars that can be approximated by barotropic structures, such as white dwarfs or main sequence stars. The gravity solver conserves angular momentum to machine precision, thanks to a ‘correction’ algorithm. This code uses HPX parallelization, allowing the overlap of work and communication and leading to excellent scaling properties, allowing for the computation of large problems in reasonable wall-clock times. In this paper, we investigate the code performance and precision by running benchmarking tests. These include simple problems, such as the Sod shock tube, as well as sophisticated, full, white-dwarf binary simulations. Results are compared to analytic solutions, when known, and to other grid based codes such as flash. We also compute the interaction between two white dwarfs from the early mass transfer through to the merger and compare with past simulations of similar systems. We measure Octo-Tiger’s scaling properties up to a core count of ∼80 000, showing excellent performance for large problems. Finally, we outline the current and planned areas of development aimed at tackling a number of physical phenomena connected to observations of transients.}",

With the application of enough stress or strain to a brittle material, atomistic scale bonds will break, leading to fracture of the macroscopic specimen. From the perspective of mechanics fracture should appear as an emergent phenomena generated by a continuum field theory eliminating the need for a supplemental kinetic relation describing crack growth. We develop a new fast method for modeling quasi-static fracture using peridynamics. We apply fixed point theory and model stable crack evolution for hard and soft loading. For soft loading we recover unstable fracture. For hard loading we recover stable crack growth. We show existence of quasistatic fracture solutions in the neighborhood of stable critical points for appropriately defined energies. The numerical method uses an analytic stiffness matrix for fast numerical implementation. A rigorous mathematical analysis shows that the method converges for load paths associated with soft and hard loading. For soft loading the crack becomes unstable shortly after the stress at the tip of the pre-crack reaches the material strength.}",

Therefore, we present the open source tool, C++Explorer, a JupyterHub deployment for interactively developing C++ code. Students can connect to the server without installing anything, and, almost instantly, they can begin to engage with code using the notebooks. Another aspect of code development is remote communication with coworkers or the community. To develop this skill, we use GitHub classroom to provide feedback on the assignments and practice remote communication. C++Explorer was used in the fall of 2019 and 2020 to teach parallel computation to mathematics students. At the end of the class, we gather students' feedback. This data will be used to continue improving the course. In addition, we present a Telegram®  bot for the communication with the server using smart phones or tablets. However, this tool was not used in the course and will be explored in future teaching.}

abstract={Computational modeling of the initiation and propagation of complex fracture is central to the discipline of engineering fracture mechanics. This review focuses on two promising approaches: phase-field (PF) and peridynamic (PD) models applied to this class of problems. The basic concepts consisting of constitutive models, failure criteria, discretization schemes, and numerical analysis are briefly summarized for both models. Validation against experimental data is essential for all computational methods to demonstrate predictive accuracy. To that end, the Sandia Fracture Challenge and similar experimental data sets where both models could be benchmarked against are showcased. Emphasis is made to converge on common metrics for the evaluation of these two fracture modeling approaches. Both PD and PF models are assessed in terms of their computational effort and predictive capabilities, with their relative advantages and challenges are summarized.},

abstract={Local-nonlocal coupling approaches provide a means to combine the computational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models. This paper studies the continuous and discrete formulations of three existing approaches for the coupling of classical linear elasticity and bond-based peridynamic models, namely (1) a method that enforces matching displacements in an overlap region, (2) a variant that enforces a constraint on the stresses instead, and (3) a method that considers a variable horizon in the vicinity of the interfaces. The performance of the three coupling approaches is compared on a series of one-dimensional numerical examples that involve cubic and quartic manufactured solutions. Accuracy of the presented methods is measured in terms of the difference between the solution to the coupling approach and the solution to the classical linear elasticity model, which can be viewed as a modeling error. The objective of the paper is to assess the quality and performance of the discrete formulation for this class of force-based coupling methods.},

abstract = {Abstract We apply a nonlinear-nonlocal field theory for numerical calculation of quasistatic fracture. The model is given by a regularized nonlinear pairwise potential in a peridynamic formulation. The potential function is given by an explicit formula with an explicit first and second derivatives. This fact allows us to write the entries of the tangent stiffness matrix explicitly thereby saving computational costs during the assembly of the tangent stiffness matrix. We validate our approach against classical continuum mechanics for the linear elastic material behavior. In addition, we compare our approach to a state-based peridynamic model that uses standard numerical derivations to assemble the tangent stiffness matrix. The numerical experiments show that for elastic material behavior our approach agrees with both classical continuum mechanics and the state-based model. The fracture model is applied to produce a fracture simulation for a ASTM E8 like tension test. We conclude with an example of crack growth in a pre-cracked square plate. For the pre-cracked plate, we investigated load in force (soft loading) and load in displacement (hard loading). Our approach is novel in that only bond softening is used as opposed to bond breaking. For the fracture simulation we have shown that our approach works with and without initial damage for two common test problems.}

abstract = {Partition of unity methods are of domain decomposition type and provide the opportunity for multiscale and multiphysics numerical modeling. Different physical models can exist within a partition of unity method scheme for handling problems with zones of linear elasticity and zones where fractures occur. Here, the peridynamic model is used in regions of fracture and smooth partition of unity methods is used in the surrounding linear elastic media. Our method is novel in that we evolve the crack path using peridynamics and apply the partition of unity method to compute the elastic fields in the neighborhood of the crack tip. Earlier work uses the peridynamic fields, e.g displacement, at the crack tip to approximate enrichment functions for the partition of unity methods. The method is a so-called global–local enrichment strategy. The elastic fields of the undamaged media provide appropriate boundary data for the localized peridynamic simulations. The geometry of the crack path in the damaged media is transferred to partition of unity method. Here, Heaviside and Westergaard functions are used to model the crack. We do not transfer information of the peridynamic fields to the partition of unity method, solely the crack geometry. The first steps for a combined peridynamic and partition of unity method simulator are presented. We show that the local peridynamic approximation can be utilized to enrich the global partition of unity method approximation to capture the true material response with high accuracy efficiently. Test problems are provided demonstrating the validity and potential of this numerical approach.}

In Octo-Tiger, an astrophysics application for the simulation of stellar mergers, we approach this with existing solutions: We employ HPX to obtain fine-grained tasks to easily distribute work and finely overlap communication and computation. For the computations themselves, we use Kokkos to turn these tasks into compute kernels capable of running on hardware ranging from a few CPU cores to powerful accelerators. There is a missing link, however: while the fine-grained parallelism exposed by HPX is useful for scalability, it can hinder GPU performance when the tasks become too small to saturate the device, causing low resource utilization. To bridge this gap, we investigate multiple different GPU work aggregation strategies within Octo-Tiger, adding one new strategy, and evaluate the node-level performance impact on recent AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, achieving noticeable speedups.},

However, on A64FX CPUs, we encountered several missing pieces, hindering performance by causing problems with the SIMD vectorization. Therefore, we add std::experimental::simd as an option to use in Octo-Tiger&amp;#x2019;s Kokkos kernels alongside Kokkos SIMD, and further add a new SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) SIMD backend. Additionally, we amend missing SIMD implementations in the Kokkos kernels within Octo-Tiger&amp;#x2019;s hydro solver. We test our changes by running Octo-Tiger on three different CPUs: An A64FX, an Intel Icelake and an AMD EPYC CPU, evaluating SIMD speedup and node-level performance. We get a good SIMD speedup on the A64FX CPU, as well as noticeable speedups on the other two CPU platforms. However, we also experience a scaling issue on the EPYC CPU.},

abstract = {Ranging from NVIDIA GPUs to AMD GPUs and Intel GPUs: Given the heterogeneity of available accelerator cards within current supercomputers, portability is a key aspect for modern HPC applications. In Octo-Tiger, an astrophysics application simulating binary star systems and stellar mergers, we rely on Kokkos and its various execution spaces for portable compute kernels. In turn, we use HPX, a distributed task-based runtime system, to coordinate kernel launches, CPU tasks, and communication. This combination allows us to have a fine interleaving between portable CPU/GPU computations and communication, enabling scalability on various supercomputers. However, for HPX and Kokkos to work together optimally, we need to be able to treat Kokkos kernels as HPX tasks. Otherwise, instead of integrating asynchronous Kokkos kernel launches into HPX’s task graph, we would have to actively wait for them with fence commands, which wastes CPU time better spent otherwise. Using an integration layer called HPX-Kokkos, treating Kokkos kernels as tasks already works for some Kokkos execution spaces (like the CUDA one), but not for others (like the SYCL one). In this work, we started making Octo-Tiger and HPX itself compatible with SYCL. To do so, we introduce numerous software changes most notably an HPX-SYCL integration. This integration allows us to treat SYCL events as HPX tasks, which in turn allows us to better integrate Kokkos by extending the support of HPX-Kokkos to also fully support Kokkos’ SYCL execution space. We show two ways to implement this HPX-SYCL integration and test them using Octo-Tiger and its Kokkos kernels, on both an NVIDIA A100 and an AMD MI100. We find modest, yet noticeable, speedups (1.11x to 1.15x for the relevant configurations) by enabling this integration, even when just running simple single-node scenarios with Octo-Tiger where communication and CPU utilization are not yet an issue. We further find that the integration using event polling within the HPX scheduler works far better than the alternative implementation using SYCL host tasks.},

In this paper, we present the comparison of the AMT systems Charm++ and HPX with the main stream MPI, OpenMP, and MPI+OpenMP libraries using the Task Bench benchmarks. Charm++ is a parallel programming language based on C++, supporting stackless tasks as well as light-weight threads asynchronously along with an adaptive runtime system. HPX is a C++ library for concurrency and parallelism, exposing C++ standards conforming API. First, we analyze the commonalities, differences, and advantageous scenarios of Charm++ and HPX in detail. Further, to investigate the potential overheads introduced by the tasking systems of Charm++ and HPX, we utilize an existing parameterized benchmark, Task Bench, wherein 15 different programming systems were implemented, e.g., MPI, OpenMP, MPI + OpenMP, and extend Task Bench by adding HPX implementations. We quantify the overheads of Charm++, HPX, and the main stream libraries in different scenarios where a single task and multi-task are assigned to each core, respectively. We also investigate each system's scalability and the ability to hide the communication latency.",

abstract="Parallel programming remains a daunting challenge, from the struggle to express a parallel algorithm without cluttering the underlying synchronous logic, to describing which devices to employ in a calculation, to correctness. Over the years, numerous solutions have arisen, many of them requiring new programming languages, extensions to programming languages, or the addition of pragmas. Support for these various tools and extensions is available to a varying degree. In recent years, the C++ standards committee has worked to refine the language features and libraries needed to support parallel programming on a single computational node. Eventually, all major vendors and compilers will provide robust and performant implementations of these standards. Until then, the HPX library and runtime provides cutting edge implementations of the standards, as well as proposed standards and extensions. Because of these advances, it is now possible to write high performance parallel code without custom extensions to C++. We provide an overview of modern parallel programming in C++, describing the language and library features, and providing brief examples of how to use them.",

Nonlocal quasistatic fracture evolution is developed and supporting numerical examples are presented. The approach is implicit and is based on local stationary and fixed point methods. Here a smooth cohesive force-strain model is used. Initially the force increases with strain then softens and decreases to zero. It is proved that the fracture evolution decreases stored elastic energy with each displacement step as the cracks advance; provided the displacement increments are chosen sufficiently small. These results apply to any system of multiple cracks. This is also seen in the numerical examples. The numerical examples include evolution of a straight crack, a crack propagating inside an L-shaped domain, and two offset inward propagating cracks.},
