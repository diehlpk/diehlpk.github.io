  Abstract                 = {This paper shows a new approach to estimate the critical traction for Mode I crack opening before crack growth by numerical simulation. For quasi-static loading, Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts the critical traction before crack growth. To simulate the crack growth, we used bond-based peridynamics, a non-local generalization of continuum mechanics. We discretize the peridynamics equation of motion with a collocation by space approach, the so-called EMU nodal discretization. As the constitutive law, we employ the improved prototype micro brittle material model. This bond-based material model is verified by the Young's modulus from classical theory for a homogeneous deformation for different quadrature rules. For the EMU-ND we studied the behavior for different ratios of the horizon and nodal spacing to gain a robust value for a large variety of materials. To access this wide range of materials, we applied sparse grids, a technique to build high-dimensional surrogate models. Sparse grids significantly reduce the number of simulation runs compared to a full grid approach and keep up a similar approximation accuracy. For the validation of the quasi-static loading process, we show that the critical traction is independent of the material density for most material parameters. The bond-based IPMB model with EMU nodal discretization seems very robust for the ratio {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}delta {\}}/{\{}{\backslash}varDelta X{\}}=3{\$}{\$} $\delta$ / $\Delta$ X = 3 for a wide range of materials, if an error of 5 {\%} is acceptable.},

abstract="Peridynamics (PD), a non-local generalization of classical continuum mechanics (CCM) allowing for discontinuous displacement fields, provides an attractive framework for the modeling and simulation of fracture mechanics applications. However, PD introduces new model parameters, such as the so-called horizon parameter. The length scale of the horizon is a priori unknown and need to be identified. Moreover, the treatment of the boundary conditions is also problematic due to the non-local nature of PD models. It has thus become crucial to calibrate the new PD parameters and assess the model adequacy based on experimental observations. The objective of the present paper is to review and catalog available experimental setups that have been used to date for the calibration and validation of peridynamics. We have identified and analyzed a total of 39 publications that compare PD-based simulation results with experimental data. In particular, we have systematically reported, whenever possible, either the relative error or the R-squared coefficient. The best correlations were obtained in the case of experiments involving aluminum and steel materials. Experiments based on imaging techniques were also considered. However, images provide large amounts of information and their comparison with simulations is in that case far from trivial. A total of six publications have been identified and summarized that introduce numerical techniques for extracting additional attributes from peridynamics simulations in order to facilitate the comparison against image-based data.",
