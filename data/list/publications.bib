  Abstract                 = {This paper shows a new approach to estimate the critical traction for Mode I crack opening before crack growth by numerical simulation. For quasi-static loading, Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts the critical traction before crack growth. To simulate the crack growth, we used bond-based peridynamics, a non-local generalization of continuum mechanics. We discretize the peridynamics equation of motion with a collocation by space approach, the so-called EMU nodal discretization. As the constitutive law, we employ the improved prototype micro brittle material model. This bond-based material model is verified by the Young's modulus from classical theory for a homogeneous deformation for different quadrature rules. For the EMU-ND we studied the behavior for different ratios of the horizon and nodal spacing to gain a robust value for a large variety of materials. To access this wide range of materials, we applied sparse grids, a technique to build high-dimensional surrogate models. Sparse grids significantly reduce the number of simulation runs compared to a full grid approach and keep up a similar approximation accuracy. For the validation of the quasi-static loading process, we show that the critical traction is independent of the material density for most material parameters. The bond-based IPMB model with EMU nodal discretization seems very robust for the ratio {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}delta {\}}/{\{}{\backslash}varDelta X{\}}=3{\$}{\$} $\delta$ / $\Delta$ X = 3 for a wide range of materials, if an error of 5 {\%} is acceptable.},

However, the technique struggles at autonomously tracking emerging and propagating cracks. We proposed a hybrid approach which utilizes image processing techniques in combination with local digital image correlation to autonomously monitor cracks in a mechanically loaded specimen. Our approach can extract and track crack surfaces and provide a volume-based visualization of the crack growth. This approach was applied to single-fiber composite experimental results with interfacial debonding from the literature. Results quantitatively show that strong interfacial fiber/matrix bonding leads to slower interfacial crack growth, delays interfacial crack growth in the matrix, requires higher loadings for crack growth and shows a specific crack path distinct from the one obtained for weak interfaces. The approach was also validated against a manual approach where a domain scientist extracts a crack using a polygon extraction tool. The method can be used on any local digital image correlation results involving damage observations."

abstract="This paper implements the virtual fields method within the ordinary state-based peridynamic framework to identify material properties. The key equations derived in this approach are based on the principle of virtual works written under the ordinary state-based peridynamic formalism for two-dimensional isotropic linear elasticity. In-house codes including a minimization process have also been developed to implement the method. A three-point bending test and two independent virtual fields arbitrarily chosen are used as a case study throughout the paper. The numerical validation of the virtual fields method has been performed on the case study by simulating the displacement field by finite element analysis. This field has been used to extract the elastic material properties and compared them with those used as input in the finite element model, showing the robustness of the approach. Noise analysis and the effect of the missing displacement fields on the specimen's edges to simulate digital image correlation limitations have also been studied in the numerical part. This work focuses on pre-damage properties to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and provides a new tool for using full-field measurements within peridynamics with a reduced calculation time as there is no need to compute the displacement field. Future works will deal with damage properties which is the main strength of peridynamics.",

abstract = "In this paper, we propose two approaches to apply boundary conditions for bond-based peridynamic models. There has been in recent years a renewed interest in the class of so-called non-local models, which include peridynamic models, for the simulation of structural mechanics problems as an alternative approach to classical local continuum models. However, a major issue, which is often disregarded when dealing with this class of models, is concerned with the manner by which boundary conditions should be prescribed. Our point of view here is that classical boundary conditions, since applied on surfaces of solid bodies, are naturally associated with local models. The paper describes two methods to incorporate classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions into bond-based peridynamics. The first method consists in artificially extending the domain with a thin boundary layer over which the displacement field is required to behave as an odd function with respect to the boundary points. The second method resorts to the idea that peridynamic models and local models should be compatible in the limit that the so-called horizon vanishes. The approach consists then in decreasing the horizon from a constant value in the interior of the domain to zero at the boundary so that one can directly apply the classical boundary conditions. We present the continuous and discrete formulations of the two methods and assess their performance on several numerical experiments dealing with the simulation of a one-dimensional bar."

abstract={On modern supercomputers, asynchronous many task systems are emerging to address the new architecture of computational nodes. Through this shift of increasing cores per node, a new programming model with focus on handling of the fine-grain parallelism with increasing amount of cores per computational node is needed. Asynchronous Many Task (AMT) run time systems represent a paradigm for addressing the fine-grain parallelism. They handle the increasing amount of threads per node and concurrency. HPX, a open source C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency, is one AMT which is conforming to the C++ standard. Motivated by the impressive performance of asynchronous task-based parallelism through HPX to N-body problem and astrophysics simulation, in this work, we consider its application to the Peridynamics theory. Peridynamics is a non-local generalization of continuum mechanics tailored to address discontinuous displacement fields arising in fracture mechanics. Peridynamics requires considerable computing resources, owing to its non-local nature of formulation, offering a scope for improved computing performance via asynchronous task-based parallelism. Our results show that HPX-based peridynamic computation is scalable, and the scalability is in agreement with the theory. In addition to the scalability, we also show the validation results and the mesh convergence results. For the validation, we consider implicit time integration and compare the result with the classical continuum mechanics (CCM) (peridynamics under small deformation should give similar results as CCM). For the mesh convergence, we consider explicit time integration and show that the results are in agreement with theoretical claims in previous works.},

    abstract = "{Octo-Tiger is an astrophysics code to simulate the evolution of self-gravitating and rotating systems of arbitrary geometry based on the fast multipole method, using adaptive mesh refinement. Octo-Tiger is currently optimised to simulate the merger of well-resolved stars that can be approximated by barotropic structures, such as white dwarfs or main sequence stars. The gravity solver conserves angular momentum to machine precision, thanks to a ‘correction’ algorithm. This code uses HPX parallelization, allowing the overlap of work and communication and leading to excellent scaling properties, allowing for the computation of large problems in reasonable wall-clock times. In this paper, we investigate the code performance and precision by running benchmarking tests. These include simple problems, such as the Sod shock tube, as well as sophisticated, full, white-dwarf binary simulations. Results are compared to analytic solutions, when known, and to other grid based codes such as flash. We also compute the interaction between two white dwarfs from the early mass transfer through to the merger and compare with past simulations of similar systems. We measure Octo-Tiger’s scaling properties up to a core count of ∼80 000, showing excellent performance for large problems. Finally, we outline the current and planned areas of development aimed at tackling a number of physical phenomena connected to observations of transients.}",
