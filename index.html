My name is Patrick Diehl, a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/">Center for Computation and Technology</a> at the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/">Louisiana State University</a>. Before joining LSU, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics at Polytechnique Montreal. I received my diploma in computer science at the university of Stuttgart and my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the university of Bonn. My main research interests are: 
<ol>
<li> Computational engineering with the focus on peridynamic material models for the application in solids, like glassy or composite materials </li>
<li> High performance computing, especially the asynchronous many task system (ATM), e.g. the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency (<a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx">HPX</a>) for large heterogeneous computations.</li>
</ol>
