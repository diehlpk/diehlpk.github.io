My name is Patrick Diehl. I am currently a research scientist in Applied Computer Science at Los Alamos National Laboratory and also serve as adjunct faculty in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/">Louisiana State University</a>. Previously, I held a position as a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/">Center for Computation and Technology</a> at LSU. Prior to my time at LSU, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/lm2/">Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics</a> at <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/">Polytechnique Montreal</a>. I earned my diploma in computer science from the University of Stuttgart and completed my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the University of Bonn. My primary research interests include:
<ol>
<li> Computational engineering with the focus on peridynamic material models for the application in solids, like glassy or composite materials </li>
<li> Developing new numerical methods for non-local models, multi-scale methods, and coupling non-local
and local models.</li>
<li> High performance computing, especially the asynchronous many task system (ATM), e.g. the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency (<a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx">HPX</a>) for large heterogeneous computations.</li>
</ol>
In addition, I am deeply passionate about leveraging Open Source software to foster greater transparency in scientific research. I am particularly interested in developing tools that facilitate the introduction of C++ and parallel computing concepts to students outside of computer science disciplines. I serve as a topic editor for the Journal of Open Source Software (<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">JOSS</a>) and hold the role of vice-chair for the USNCM technical thrust area focusing on Large Scale Structural Systems and Optimal Design. Furthermore, I am proud to be a co-author of the book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9783031543685">book</a> "Parallel C++: Efficient and Scalable High-Performance Parallel Programming Using HPX".
