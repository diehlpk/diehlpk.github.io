My name is Patrick Diehl, a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/">Center for Computation and Technology</a> and adjunct faculty at the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/physics/">Department of Physics & Astronomy</a> at the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/">Louisiana State University</a>. Before joining LSU, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/lm2/">Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics</a> at <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/">Polytechnique Montreal</a>. I received my diploma in computer science at the University of Stuttgart and my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Bonn. My main research interests are: 
<ol>
<li> Computational engineering with the focus on peridynamic material models for the application in solids, like glassy or composite materials </li>
<li> Developing new numerical methods for non-local models, multi-scale methods, and coupling non-local
and local models.</li>
<li> High performance computing, especially the asynchronous many task system (ATM), e.g. the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency (<a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx">HPX</a>) for large heterogeneous computations.</li>
</ol>

In addition, I have a deep interest in the usage of <a href="https://flossforscience.github.io/">Open source software</a> to enhance the openness of Science. With respect to teaching, I am interested to develop <a href="https://osf.io/ag4sr/">tools</a> to easily introduce C++ and parallel computing to non-computer science students. I am a topic editor for the Journal of Open Source Software (<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">JOSS</a>). I am the vice-chair of the <a href="https://unsacm.memberclicks.net/tta--large-scale-structural-systems">USNCM technical thrust area for Large Scale Structural Systems and Optimal Design</a>.
