My name is Patrick Diehl and currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory for Multi scale Mechanics at the Polytechnique Montreal. I studied computer science at the university of Stuttgart and received my diploma there. My research interests are computational engineering, here with the focus on the comparison of simulations with experiments, and peridynamics. Additionally, I am interested in HPC for running large simulations on hybrid cluster architectures. For more details please refer to my <a href="http://diehlpk.github.io/cv/">CV</a>.
