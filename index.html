My name is Patrick Diehl and currently I am researcher at the Center for Computation and Technology at the Lousiana State University. I received my diploma in computer science at the university of Stuttgart and my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the university of Bonn. My research interests are computational engineering, here with the focus on the comparison of simulations with experiments, and peridynamics. Additionally, I am interested in HPC for running large simulations on hybrid cluster architectures. Furthermore, I got interest in <a href="https://opendataexpmechanics.github.io/">Open Data in Experimental Mechanics</a> and the usage of <a href="https://flossforscience.github.io/">Open source software</a> in research. For more details please refer to my <a href="https://diehlpk.github.io/cv/">CV</a>.
