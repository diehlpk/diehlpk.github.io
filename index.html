Patrick Diehl is a research scientist specializing in Applied Computer Science at Los Alamos National Laboratory and also serves as adjunct faculty in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Louisiana State University. Prior to his current role, he was a research scientist at the Center for Computation and Technology at LSU. Before joining LSU, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics at Polytechnique Montreal. I hold a diploma in computer science from the University of Stuttgart and earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Bonn. My primary research interests include:
<ol>
<li> Quantum computing simualtions on emulators and quantum computers</li>
<li> Portable High performance computing, especially the asynchronous many task system (ATM), e.g. the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency (<a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx">HPX</a>) and Kokkos for large heterogeneous computations.</li>
<li> Computational engineering with the focus on peridynamic material models for the application in solids, like glassy or composite materials </li>
<li> Developing new numerical methods for non-local models, multi-scale methods, and coupling non-local
and local models.</li>
</ol>
He is passionate about advancing openness in science and currently serves as a topic editor for the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). Additionally, Patrick is the co-author of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9783031543685">book</a> Parallel C++: Efficient and Scalable High-Performance Parallel Programming Using HPX. Patrick is committed to teaching high-performance computing to both staff and students, with a broader focus on higher education. He actively contributes to the ISO C++ SG20 working group, where he helps shape the agenda for teaching modern C++.
