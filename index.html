My name is Patrick Diehl, a staff member at the <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/">Center for Computation and Technology</a> at the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/">Louisiana State University</a>. I received my diploma in computer science at the university of Stuttgart and my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the university of Bonn. My main research interests are: (1) Computational engineering with the focus on peridynamic material models for the application in solids, like glassy or composite materials. (2) High performance computing, especially the asynchronous many task system (ATM), e.g. the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency ([HPX]()), which is used to run large simulations for the validation against experimental data. 

In addition, I have a deep interest in <a href="https://opendataexpmechanics.github.io/">Open Data in Experimental Mechanics</a> and the usage of <a href="https://flossforscience.github.io/">Open source software</a> in research. For more details please refer to my <a href="https://diehlpk.github.io/cv/">CV</a>.
